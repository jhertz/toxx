Super simple script to seed a bracket based on GARPR

Setting up:
- pychallonge
- requests
- python 2.7.X

How To Use:

This program expects two files in the same directory as it runs out of:


-creds.txt: This file will contain your username and api_key to your challonge account.
    It should be in the following format:
    
    username
    api-key
    
Yup thats it, a plain text file with two seperate lines! Make sure there's a line break between the two!!!
    
-bracket.txt: This file will contain the name of the bracket.
    This is the name that shows up in the challonge URL (if your bracket was http://challonge.com/fox then this file should just have one line, which says fox)


Caveats:
-Right now, you’ll have to change the region to a different region if you want to use this outside of NYC. Just edit the python script and change the string.
-Any players who aren’t found in GARPR will be seeded at the bottom. So make sure to adjust that if needed!
