to load gecko/ocarina codes for your specific loader. chances are, you'll
want the GCT one, unless you want to modify the codeset


##### usage
most of the codes are self explanatory. however...

- Stage Striking: on the stage select screen, press Y to strike all stages not currently on the random select. press X to strike a stage. press Z to unstrike everything
- Rumble Changing: on the character select screen, press up on the d-pad to turn rumble on. your chars background will become white. press down on the d-pad to turn it off, your background will go back to grey
